# Laboratory 02 — Computer Vision 

This repository contains the materials for Laboratory Practice 02: Computer vision. The laboratory consists in completing the challenge in the `challenge.ipynb` notebook.

Remember to extract the `data.zip` files before running the notebook.

All necessary instructions are in the notebook. This is much less guided than the previous one, so I recommend you to think and revisit the theory slides to come up with ideas.

Good luck and enjoy the lab!
